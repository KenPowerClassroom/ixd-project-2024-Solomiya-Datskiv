            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app. Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our users.<br>
                Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education. The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment.<br>
                This project involved various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. The competitive analysis will helped me identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlight areas we can improve.<br>
                Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.<br>
                Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and functionality. The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.<br>
                Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes.<br></p>

                        <td class="green">Kahoot App is colorful and engaging because it incorporates a variety of interactive elements. Most people probably know this app for its quizzes which have known sound effects. There are also animations to capture users' attention. Through quizzes and interactive features, the app keeps user attention by challenge and reward. And I believe it keeps a good balance between them. 9/10 </td>
                        <td class="green">The interface of Khan Academy is visually appealing, it uses some gamification elements, has high-quality visuals and engaging educational content. App uses sound and animation effectively for learning and it especially helps user with understanding complex concepts. We can see how the app mixes challenging exercises and rewards through comprehensive progress tracking. 9/10 </td>
                        <td class="yellow">Photomath interface is not bad, but itâ€™s quite limited and focused on solving mathematical problems. It has very limited sound and animation, more focused on problem-solving. 6/10 </td>

                        <td class="yellow">Users can track their progress through quizzes and scores. Kahoot has many user-friendly, helpful features and provides user feedback. But unfortunately, this app has limited recommendations for improvement. The personalization in Kahoot based on quiz performance is also very limited. 6/10 </td>
                        <td class="green">Khan Academy is very good at tracking user progress across various subjects. It gives the user help while learning and provides very detailed feedback and recommendations. The app perfectly personalizes the interface and overall learning journey, adapting content based on personal progress and needs. 10/10 </td>
                        <td class="red">Photomath can help user progress through displaying step-by-step solutions and explanations, but it doesn't really have a progress tracking system. The app offers instant feedback on problem-solving, but recommendations for improvement are limited. The app primarily focused on enhancing math-solving skills and doesn't really have personalization options. 4/10 </td>
